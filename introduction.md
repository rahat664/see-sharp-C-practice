## C#
 - C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.
 - It was developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270).
 - C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure.
 - C# is used for developing desktop applications, web applications, and games.
 - C# is an object-oriented, component-oriented programming language. C# provides language constructs to directly support these concepts, making C# a natural language in which to create and use software components.
 - C# is a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative led by Anders Hejlsberg.

## .Net Architecture
 - .NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
 - With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, and IoT.
 - .NET has many different libraries and frameworks, which are used for building different types of applications.
 - C# programs run on .NET, a virtual execution system called the common language runtime (CLR) and a set of class libraries. 
 - The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure (CLI), an international standard. 
 - The CLI is the basis for creating execution and development environments in which languages and libraries work together seamlessly.

## HELLO WORLD
 - The following is a simple C# program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:
```csharp
    using System;
    class Program
    {
        static void Main()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
```
- The program begins with the keyword `using`, which is used to include the `System` namespace in the program. 
- The `System` namespace contains the `Console` class, which is used to read from and write to the console.
- The `Main` method is where the program starts execution.
- The `Console.WriteLine` method prints the message "Hello, World!" to the console.
